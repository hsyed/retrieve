========

Just a showcase project that I wrote to demonstrate working with Scala / Futures / Akka / Spray / Slick / Posgres / Json / RESTfullness etc. The code quality is mixed as I am growing the codebase and refactoring it. All of the testing is done on the interpreter for now.

Spray Service for Working with Media Related Api's Freebase / trakt / Rotten Tomatoes etc. 

This codebase was used to autonamously(well almost) copy lists of movies matching certain predicates from [freebase to trakt](http://trakt.tv/user/hsyed/lists). 12 years of Cannes, 50 ish films per year, on average 5 films missing from trakt. 

The functionality will grow in other directions. 

The trakt code needs a lot of refactoring :D The code under the freebase package is better to look at.
